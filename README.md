# Smart-parking-system

# Project Description:
This project aims to develop a smart parking system using Arduino and IoT technologies to efficiently manage parking spaces. 
The system will utilize sensors to detect the availability of parking spots and provide real-time information to drivers, allowing them to easily find vacant spaces. 
By implementing this IoT-based solution, the project will enhance parking space utilization and reduce congestion in parking lots.

# Components:
Arduino Uno: The Arduino board will serve as the central control unit for the smart parking system. It will process data from sensors and communicate with the IoT platform.

Ultrasonic Sensors: Ultrasonic sensors will be used to detect the presence of vehicles in parking spaces. Each parking spot will be equipped with a sensor to determine if it is occupied or vacant.

IoT Platform: An IoT platform like Blynk or Thingspeak will be utilized to connect the Arduino board with the internet. The platform will enable real-time data transfer and remote access to the parking system.

LCD Display: An LCD display will provide a user-friendly interface to show the availability of parking spaces in real-time. It will display messages such as "Vacant" or "Occupied" for each parking spot.

LEDs: LEDs can be used to indicate the status of each parking spot visually. For example, green for vacant and red for occupied spaces.

# Arduino Code and Functionality:
Initialize the ultrasonic sensors, LCD display, LEDs, and Wi-Fi module (if using).
Continuously monitor the status of parking spaces using the ultrasonic sensors.
Update the LCD display and LEDs based on the sensor readings to indicate the availability of parking spots.
Establish a connection with the IoT platform and send real-time data about the parking space status.
Implement a user interface on the IoT platform to allow users to view the parking space availability remotely.
If the parking lot is full, the system can send a notification to the user, indicating that no parking spaces are available.
Optional (Add-on): Implement additional features like a mobile app or a website for users to access parking information on their smartphones or computers.
